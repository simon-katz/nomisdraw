** Design notes
*** TODO Do you have another re-com-extras (n√©e re-com-utils) ns somewhere?
**** piano-xxxx?
**** env-viewer?
*** TODO Maybe ask for `qs-maybe-non-api/destroy-previous-sketch` to be part of the API
**** (or if he has other suggestions...)
*** TODO Maybe move `nomisdraw.utils.nomis-quil-on-reagent` to a library
**** and reply at
***** http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33345084/quil-sketch-on-a-reagent-canvas
**** Would be good not to use re-com there
