* TODO
** Why is CPU 100% even when no animation?
** The Quil stuff gets slower and slower when making selections from the dropdown
*** and when Figwheel reloads
*** (Note that CPU usage only happens when the browser is visible (right?))
*** Google Chrome Helper goes to 100% when you first select the Quil stuff
**** and stays at 100% when you switch back from the Quil stuff
** The dropdown stuff maybe belongs in a re-com-utils ns
*** (do you have one in piano-xxxx or env-viewer?)
