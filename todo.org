* TODO
** Why is CPU 100% even when no animation?
*** Ah, Quil is an animation library
**** If I set the frame rate low, CPU usage is low
**** The draw function is called repeatedly
** The Quil stuff gets slower and slower when making selections from the dropdown
*** and when Figwheel reloads
*** (Note that CPU usage only happens when the browser is visible (right?))
*** Google Chrome Helper goes to 100% when you first select the Quil stuff
**** and stays at 100% when you switch back from the Quil stuff
*** Weird because Quil 2.4.0 has this commit:
When canvas element is reused - destroy previous processing object soâ€¦
https://github.com/quil/quil/commit/be03cdeb61e78ecf4d3e09a5fb8e8d3658631816
*** Hacky fix: wrap draw function in a check for being unmounted
** The dropdown stuff maybe belongs in a re-com-utils ns
*** (do you have one in piano-xxxx or env-viewer?)
