;;;; Making Quil work well with Reagent...
;;;; - I got the core idea from skrat's answer at
;;;;   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33345084/quil-sketch-on-a-reagent-canvas
;;;; - I've made it more functional.

  - The `:host` argument must not be provided. (Instead, a unique canvas id is
    created.)
  - Returns a component that wraps C.
  - The :size argument must be either `nil` or a [width height] vector."
